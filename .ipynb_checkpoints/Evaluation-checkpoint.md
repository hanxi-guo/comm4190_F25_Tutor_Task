# subjective experience:
For the first one, it gave me way too much information at the beginning. It took a long time to read, and it didn’t even ask what I had already learned or whether I needed those things, which made me feel a bit uncomfortable. When I tried to ask some specific questions, it still gave me a bunch of information instead of just explaining things simply. And the useful part felt too small compared to how much I had to read. Also, when I tried to distract it by sadly/negative response, it kept giving very structured, logical, and objective answers, but not much emotional support. In the end, I was actually able to change the topic from our R study to asking which iris flower it liked, which surprised me since I thought it would stick to the topic I started with. It also made me switch to RStudio to do the tasks it gave, which wasn’t very convenient.

For the second one, it felt much better. It first checked what I had already learned, which made sense. When it started teaching, it used a simple example first which was much easier to follow than listing functions and grammar one by one like the first one did. I also liked that I didn’t need to switch to RStudio; it just gave me small puzzles I could answer right in the chat box, which was way more convenient. When I got distracted or felt a bit down, it seemed to understand and gave me some emotional support, whether my answers were right or not. Even when I tried to change the topic, it stayed focused and encouraged me to keep going with R.


# observation

1.	Sentence style and rhythm

- In the Personalized AI Tutoring Guide, it often used short, encouraging lines like:
  
> “Exactly! You’re on the right track.”
> “Take your time — learning is not a race.”

Those short phrases made the conversation feel more natural and friendly, and it was easier to stay engaged.

- Data Cleaning in R sounded more structured and step-by-step, like:
  
> “First, we’ll load the dataset using read_csv(). Then we can inspect missing values with is.na().”

It’s clear and well-organized but feels more like a tutorial than a chat.

2.	Voice and pronouns
- Personalized AI Tutoring Guide used “you” and “we” a lot, like:
> “We can figure this out together.”

That gave me a feeling of learning with someone.
- Data Cleaning in R mostly used instructions, like:
“Use drop_na() to remove rows with missing values.”
It’s straightforward, but not very personal.
3.	Emotional tone
- Personalized AI Tutoring Guide gave a lot of positive and caring feedback, like:
“That’s a really interesting thought.” or “It’s okay to feel stuck.”
It felt warm and encouraging — good for beginners.
- Data Cleaning in R didn’t really have any emotional tone; it just focused on the technical stuff:
“drop_na(age, income) removes rows where these columns have missing values.”
It’s neutral and clear, but kind of cold.
