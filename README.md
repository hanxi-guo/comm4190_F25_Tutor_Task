# 🎯 Testing LLMs as a Data Cleaning Tutor (in R)

## Overview
This project tests how structured prompting shapes the tutoring behavior of a large language model (LLM).  
The chosen learning task is **Data Cleaning and Summarization in R**.
Two tutoring sessions were run. One unstructured (“vanilla”) and one using the [*Mollick Structured Tutor Prompt*](https://www.moreusefulthings.com/student-exercises) which followed by a modified-prompt experiment.  
All sessions were analyzed to evaluate how prompt structure changes clarity, tone, and engagement in tutoring communication.
